# simp-firmware
A simple firmware for the simp macropad (a project of my own, I'll publish it in the near future as well), written in C using the LUFA library.

Note: *This project is under heavy development, I'm generally experimenting a lot and constantly learning new stuff about C and microcontrollers.*
